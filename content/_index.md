## Now

Right now I am exploring the possibility of becoming a technical writer. It's my 2023 job change.

I'm thinking about **Lower Power**. 
It's a riff on Higher Power from the 12 step culture. 
They have a phrase "lower power" that doesn't have good connotations. 
But I'm intersted in it because of my work with the body, the lower center of power in the pelvis (far away from the head), plus the spirit of the _depths_ that Jung talked about. 

Ongoing:
- dream work with Marc Bregman
- Tuesday night process group
- live in my group house, share a bedroom with Irene
    - Sei is with us half time
- work as a BC for a FedEx Ground contractor out of Broomfield, CO
