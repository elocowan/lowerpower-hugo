## This is all about where I record my life.

In the short term past:
- I used to write down my dreams in Roam
- then I re-read the Derek Sivers post where he recommends using plain text files

That was a big transition, actually.
Because plain text led me to vim.
Vim lead me back to nerdy computer stuff.
I realized I could write little functions to make it easier to journal.
I knew enough from my coding bootcamp to realize I could write functions to automate things.
And I could write them for bash.
I could write functions that would do stuff with my FileSystem.
That's not anything I realized was possible in bootcamp.
Everything in bootcamp was about Web Development.
Server requests. Databases. Browsers.
This was new because it was about what happens on _MY_ computer.

I wrote two little functions:

```dream```

to write down dreams in the middle of the night

```ij```

to add entries to daily interstitial journals

There's a lot more to say/write about why I was using Roam.
I want to go into it more somewhere else, but the short version is that it started when my friend Daniel told me about Building a Second Brain.
I got way into the idea of note-taking (again, something I liked to do already but didn't do in a digital way).
And that led me to be influenced by Tasshin, to get on Twitter, and to see what other people were up to in that space.
It all led me, eventually, to be using Roam.
Which I really liked because it always opened with a daily page.
It seemed built for aimless journaling that could come together later.
And I loved to aimlessly journal and imagine it would all come together later.

I got into Roam after I was into Evernote.
It's easy to remember that because I was still using Evernote when I was in the coding bootcamp.

I want to record here, too, that I did the coding bootcamp very soon after I met Irene.
When we took our first trip together to mexico, right before COVID, I brought along a ThinkPad with Emacs and I was studying the pre-course material for Hack Reactor.

When I switched from Roam to plain text files, it was the middle of January, 2023, a little more than a month ago.
This was a big transition, off the internet.
It's part of a bigger picture for me.
It's part of getting away from compulsive behavior and compulsory activities.
My first Feldenkrais motto, that I got from Dennis, was "Increase Choice, Decrease Compulsion"
And moving my journaling from the browser onto my desktop was an important moment.
It coincided with emerging from the compulsory overwhelm of the peak season at FedEx.
It also coincided with my emergence from the chaos of my relationship with Irene.
It coincided with a realization that I want to spend significant amounts of time by myself, journaling, working on stuff.
And I didn't want to be spending my time dealing with the chaos.
It's a bigger picture that's kind of hard for me to see clearly.
But I'm seeing it alright this morning, so I'm trying to sketch what I can.

One thing that's interesting is that the step after using plain txt files is that now I'm moving to markdown files.
I'm doing that so Hugo can render them as HTML.
So some of my activity is moving me back towards the browser.

A couple things about that:
1. The browser doesn't need to be connected to the internet for me to see the contents of my files because I'm just using the Hugo development server.
    * so I can keep myself not distracted, unplugged from the perils of the place
2. The browser allows hyperlinking, among other things... It's kind of like a GUI for the file system I'm making. So the "content in it's purest form" remains almost as simple as plain text files, but the representation and structuring of that text data gets slightly more fancy and composable and maybe attractive and also the 'performance' of seeing it makes me write more formally.
3. It makes me think of a project that would be kind of cool to do: what if I made myself a journaling APP, so that I had something like a browser that wasn't connected to the internet, somewhere I could navigate (aka *read*) my content

The bigger picture is, I love to write.
I love to document experience in words.
This fits into my cultural landscape very differently since the advent of personal computing, and even more since the advent of social media.
Now everyone loves to write about themselves, and everyone can, in a public way.
I'm no different, I guess.
But I want to keep the focus on me, and so I want to make some software that keeps it contained.
I want to be more of a producer, less of a consumer.
The social media landscape changes the tenor of this activity.
It incentivizes certain types of performativity that change behavior into loops of certain kinds of social feedback.
I want the feedback to come from my dreams, not other people.

It was a big revelation to understand that a computer can be used for many many things, not just the skinner box reward system the social media giants have turned it into.

The way that looked for me was realizing, I can write text files and keep them in my FileSystem.
I don't need to write all of this down in an app that someone else created.
I don't need to write this all in a browser where my next click will probably be to a social media site.

And that's another thing I wish had been different about Hack Reactor.
It was focused on JavaScript and Web Development because that's the big thing right now...
BUT, it would have been cool if it had been more about computer science or if it had been a systems administrator bootcamp, or something like that.
There are so many things for computers to do that don't require being on the internet.
This realization helped me see that I could be interested in using computers in ways that aren't feeding into the attention economy but are more focused on self-improvement.
It was a big deal to realize I could write myself those two little helper functions, to make it easier to write down dreams in the middle of the night and to do interstitial journaling.
The realization is, this is MY COMPUTER, and I can do stuff with it for myself.
I can disconnect it from the internet.
I can disconnect it from all of the stuff.
It's hard to explain why that isn't immediately obvious.

But I know that getting into the terminal program helped (harkeing back to DOS days).
I know that learning Vim (and feeling connected back to UNIX days) helped.
I know I went through a moment when I wanted to have EVERYTHING running in the terminal.
CMUS for music.
I wanted an email thing in the terminal.
I wanted a habit tracker in the terminal...

The bigger picture is that I really love to journal.
It would be cool if I could do that and get paid.
I think that's part of what this interest in becoming a Technical Writer is about.
But it also might be what making a journaling app could be about.
Personal journal.
Not for sharing.
Personal computing.
