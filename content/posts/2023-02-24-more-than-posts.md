## Pages vs. Posts

I have lots of ideas about what I want to do with computers.
The most pressurized idea is Get a Job.
But there are other ideas too.
I want to learn C.
I want to go through the curriculum of [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
I want to build a habit tracker.
I want to build a screentime dashboard for macOS, to curb my bad screentime habits.
Basically, I want to understand computers better, because they are so ubiquitous and the site of almost all of my compulsive behavior.

A computer is a tool, but right now it feels like the tool uses me, somehow.

Anyway, I want to write more than just posts on this website.
I like the idea of having the blog, because it can be a record of my thoughts about what to do...
But I also want to have project areas on the site so that I have a sense of making progress and also finishing stuff.

Making a blog is one of the things I want to do.
I also have the idea of becoming a technical writer.
I want to write a post about my education, the trainings I've done and what types of professional life I thought they'd lead to vs. what they did lead to.
That could be a blog post.

But it would be great to have a spot on this website where I have a list of ideas.
It would be a list of possibilities, projects that it might be cool to do.
It would be more like a PAGE, a page that gets updated.

An ideas page.
And a now page.
Other types of pages would be the about page and the home page.

I think the first page I should make is the now page, because that's the place I can update which of the ideas I am working on now.
The ideas page is kind of like a queue.
"My queue"
The first thing on "my queue" should be to make "my queue" and "now"
