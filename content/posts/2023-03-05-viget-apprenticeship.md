I woke up this morning thinking about the Viget apprenticeship program.

I learned about it a couple of years ago.
I was dissatisfied with the work at Synchronicity.
I didn't want to be just implementing designs.
So I thought that UX might be a better part of the tech field to get involved in.

Davis connected me to Becky at Viget two years ago, in March 2021.
There is an apprenticeship program at Viget.
Starts in the Fall, applications would be this spring or summer.
Looks like last summer the deadline was actually as late as august.

I'm considering writing based on the fact that it would be more mellow than what I'm currently doing.
Viget has apprenticeships in project management, product strategy, UX, UI.
I'm thinking that UX is a possibility based on my conversation with Ted Burnham.
There is potentially significant overlap between Technical Writing and UX writing.

One thing that's exciting about the idea of being involved in UX is how that might tie in with my bureoning interest in Humane Technology.
I could make a case that what I'm interested in is helping users (myself, mostly) experience more choice and less compulsion around technology.
And that kind of question has a LOT to do with User Experience.

The Viget apprenticeship related to UX has the title UX Strategist
