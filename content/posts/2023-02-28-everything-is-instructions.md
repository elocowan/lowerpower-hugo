## The thread through

Technical writing is about instructions.
It's all about helping people with reference material.
"Getting Started."
How to do this certain thing.

Strangely, we live in a world where it's possible to watch a bunch of how-to material for entertainment.
It's very easy to be a consumer of "how to" without every actually doing the thing.

But I'm seeing that there is a thread that connects this Technical Writing aspiration to other parts of my life.
It connects to all my "engrossed" stories because all those stories are based on me following instructions.
1. History Day - instructions on how to do research
2. Development Area - implied instructions from Bill Viola (I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like)
3. Bachelor Machine - instructions on how to do MyStory
4. Feldencast - instructions on how to make a Gatsby Site, How to Make a Podcast

I'm making it map a little *too* cleanly, but there's a thread here.
I love using instructions in a creative way, to achieve my own ends.

And this project of becoming a technical writer has legs because it is another chance for me to follow some instructions _and_ tailor them to my needs.

Plus, the internet is an enormous repository of instructions at this point.
And making myself a site where I document the instructions that have been most helpful to me...

Oh...
6. Reading the book "History of Last Night's Dream" is another example of reading an instructional book about How to Dream

It's helpful to have this bigger picture.
This relates to me understanding my purpose.
And it also embeds the desire to become a technical writer into a bigger composition of my life.
It makes sense to pursue a career that is about making content that helps people do stuff.
But making that a writing activity instead of a face-to-face activity.
