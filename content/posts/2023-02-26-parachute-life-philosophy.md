## Parachute Part 2

My philosophy about life:
I desperately want to find my purpose in life. 
I have an intuition that I must have one. 
But I've forgotten.
There are clues to my purpose.
My dreams.
My family, why did I choose them?
My life experiences, especially the times in my life when I've felt like I was on the right track and being helped forward by something other than my will power.
I am not quite a believer yet, but I have a growing sense of a divine aspect of being alive.
I am seeking more knowledge about why I am here, what my purpose is in life.

## I am a person who already has (and loves) these particular knowledges (or interests):  
1. My favorite hobbies are dancing, journaling, Feldenkrais, writing, composing stuff (music, videos, audio).
2. I love to talk about present moment experience, about philosophy, about aesthetics... I love process groups.
3. I love reading magazine articles about artists, authors, creative people who make things. I also love reading magazine articles about history.
4. I like reading newspaper articles about local businesses, the stories about people who have created stuff. I like knowing the histories of creation.
5. In a bookstore I like to browse the staff recommendations. I like to go to the art sections, the religion sections, and I like to look for specific books that were recommended by experts. I want to know what the "good stuff" is.
6. On the internet, I like to go to personal websites of individuals with blogs... I'm interested in the individual personalities and how they've decided to represent themselves. It's fascinating to find people who've got their idiosyncratic take on coding, programming, making a life online that seems a bit composed, contained. Not messy social media, but people who've considered how they want things to be organized on their website.
7. On TV, I like travel shows. I like documentaries about old places, real places, different cultures.
8. When I look at courses, I'd like to take woodworking courses, computer courses. Courses about how to do specific things.
9. If I could write a book that wasn't about my own life or someone else's, the book would be about music and the way it relates to spiritual experience.
10. When I get engrossed in activities to the point that I lose all sense of time, it's when I'm working on a creative project that was sparked by something inside me. Almost all of my seven stories about enjoying myself involve this kind of engrossment... And they were all about documenting a set of aesthetic ideas and composing them in various media.
