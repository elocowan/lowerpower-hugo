## Who do I know already?

The parachute book says LinkedIn is super helpful for finding people to connect with.
He recommends doing informational interviews with folks.
So I looked up "Technical Writer" and saw who I am linked to, by various degrees of separation.
The first person who came up who has a mutual connection is a Staff Technical Writer at GitHub.
Lucien Heart is the mutual connection, so I sent Lucien a kind of generic message explaining that I'm looking for folks to talk to about getting into the field.
He wrote back today and told me to get in touch with Ted, someone he used to work with at a place called Avanoo

It was enough of a stretch to write one message to someone, so after that I started looking at who my connections on LinkedIn actually are.
I scrolled through the list to see who I know from the coding bootcamp, who I know from elsewhere.

And the damndest thing happened, when I got down to Scott Melamed, I saw that _he is a technical writer_!
Crazy, one of my best friends from college is already in the field.
He works for a medical company, so it's not software technical writing.
But damn, I'm going to talk to him anyway!
Very interesting surprise.
And it would be really fun to share that kind of work connection with Scott.
