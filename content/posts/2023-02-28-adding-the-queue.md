## Not quite a To Do list

I added a [Queue](/queue) to the navigation bar.
This is a place for me to consolidate my little flights of inspiration.
I'm not calling it a to do list.
It's more of an experimental recording.

I want it to stand in relation to the as yet unrealized Now page.
And of course it will stand in relation to the Log page.
The log page is the daily stream.
The queue is the screen that catches chunks of idea that comes through the log stream - chunks that could be valuable in the future if they were realized.
And I guess the Now page will be about keeping track of which things from the Queue I'm actually working on.
Which pieces of gold am I shaping into something?

All of this is related to making a workflow.
This is like me reinventing Trello or a KanBan.
But it's more organic.
This is the set up that I'm inventing.
These are the names that I am giving these things.
There's something empowering about doing it myself.
