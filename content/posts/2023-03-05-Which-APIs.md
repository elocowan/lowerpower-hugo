Feeling into whether or not I'd like to pursue the Viget apprenticeship, the attractive part is that it starts in the fall and it would mean a definite end date for Bach SJ, hopefully before CU move in.

On the other hand, I am not as excited about any of the internships as I am about (the idea of) technical writing and documentation.

Maybe it would be good to get any paid experience in the tech field, even if it's not related to technical writing.
I did hear from both Ted and Scott that technical writing has overlap with project management and UX...

My other thoughts today had to do with specialization in the tech writing field.
There's this course specifically about APIs, and there's something attractive about the idea that I could learn how to do a really specific thing and that could lead to aa job.

At the end of the day I fantasized more about writing API documentation.
I think the project within the API documentation course is about creating documentation for a Weather API.
I wondered about how many APIs there actually are?
Maybe it would be cool to do some research to find out about a whole slew of APIs that I think are interesting or notable
I thought about what other APIs are out there that might be interesting to know about or even use.

I'd like to learn more about whatever internal apple API screen time uses...
Maybe that would be a cool documentation project to add to my portfolio.
I assume the API documentation already exists, but that doesn't mean that I couldn't make my own version of it as a learning project.
