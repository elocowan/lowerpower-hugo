Seek and you shall find.

It turns out there is a perfect opportunity for me to do a writing project at my current job.
When we hire new drivers, we have to train them.
We have a curriculum for safety training provided by GroundCloud.
But we don't have training for the actual driving and delivering.
Right now, our training process is to send new guys with experienced guys.
We don't specify what the experienced guys should show the new guys.
We just leave it up to them, as far as I can tell.

It would be great to standardize the training.
We are considering putting the new hires with one of us managers for their first couple days on the road.
And I want to make a very specific curriculum that we can use over and over, to make sure all the important stuff is covered.

I also want to do it as a potential portfolio piece for technical writing jobs.

So, I want to have a nice piece of finished work eventually.
I want to have diagrams.
I want to have well written descriptions.
I want bite-sized chunks.
Broken down over two days.
And I want the whole thing to hang together.

## First Pass at Subjects to Cover
- Technologies
	- Station Orientation
		- Guard Shack
		- Check In Office for Badge Photo
		- Printer for HazMat
	- Van Line Orientation
		- Route Number Labels
			- On the Ground
			- Above the Belt
		- Explanation of package handler roles
		- Set expectations about how well or completely the truck will be loaded when you arrive
		- QA
			- Each belt has a Quality Assurance person
			- They tape up your boxes
			- They can answer questions about bad addresses
			- They can deal with packages that Need Inspection (code 10)
			- They are here to help us take out every package we can.
		- Managers
			- There will always be a manager close by to answer questions or help with packages
	- Truck
		- Sections and working the truck, from front to back or vice versa...
		- at the very least, need to have the first few sections really well loaded.
		- Anatomy of an SID Sticker
		- Pre-trip inspection
			- DETAILS - what are the most important things to check?
	- The Two Devices (scanner and iPad)
		- Conceptual Orientation
			- FedEx give sequence numbers, their computers plan the routes
			- You could run the route with only a scanner... All the info is in there, including a map that can give you directions.
			- GroundCloud is nice because it makes the map bigger, and gives it way more functionality (map settings. what else?)
			- GroundCloud also has other features, like the time clock (maybe moot with homebase).
			- The important point is that GroundCloud gets the information from FedEx.
			- FedEx does not get any information from GroundCloud.
			- One way data flow.
			- The people who DO get information from GroundCloud are BACH SJ managers.
				- We can use GroundCloud to follow up on misdelivered packages, for example.
				- We can also use GroundCloud for Fleet Tracking
				- We can use it for information about drivers, information about how the routes are going, stops per hour, etc.
			- So for us, GroundCloud is very important.
			- But the thing that matters to FedEx is the scanner. 
			- It's important to be accurate with the use of both the scanner and the iPad.
			- But priority should be given to the scanner.
		- Scanner
			- logging in
			- clear explanation of every screen you go through (with diagrams)
			- being fully logged in to the scanner
			- orientation to menus
		- iPad
			- log in to Ground Cloud
			- time clock
			- dashboard that shows route number
				- if you're ever not sure what route you're on, you can check on any iPad
	- Clothing
		- policy is for only FedEx Branded clothing, including hats
	- Office Trucks
		- Scanner Batteries
		- Charged iPads
		- what other things do we want guys to know about?
	- Homebase?

- Sequence
	- Clock In
	- Log In to Scanner
	- Organize Truck
	- pre-plan the route
		- understand what is on the map
		- don't depend on the navigation more than you have to - use your HEAD
		- what to do with ICs?
	- pre-trip inspection
		- gas card
		- extra scanner batteries
		- check iPad battery and cables to see if charging is working
	- Two Types of Stops
		- Anatomy of a Stop
			- The screen
			- Special Instructions - "The Portal" and our contractual obligtation to follow special instructions
			- A stop can have more than one package, and a stop can include both Deliveries and Pickups (depends on what tab has the focus).
			- A Tracking Number is how the FedEx system keeps track of packages from the moment they're picked up until the moment they're delivered.
			- Everytime a package gets scanned, the computer system gives it some kind of code in the system - "van scan" is an example...
			- EVERY STOP GETS A STATUS CODE
				- When you make a successful delivery, the system applies a code 14
			- If you're unable to complete a stop, you give that tracking number a different code
		- SERVICE Score
		- Deliveries
			- Businesses
				- Always need a signature
			- Residential
				- Always front door with a picture
				- Met Customer is okay only if you actually met the customer.
				- Locker and mailroom are okay at certain apartment complexes where we have access to mailrooms.
				- DEFAULT take a picture, this will protect you if a customer complains about not receiving their package
			- Door Tags
			- Packages in the wrong section or you couldn't find one until the end of the day.
				- We set the routes up so that the sequence moves away from the station, so you should be able to backtrack and hit any stops that you missed.
			- Real Time Scanning 
				- if you find a package that you know you won't be able to attempt, you need to give it a status code right away.
		- Pickups
			- Scheduled Pickups
			- Call Tags
			- FDOs
			- Common Codes for Unsuccessful Pickup Attempts
		- Customer Pickup Coordinator (CPC)
			- they answer questions about bad addresses
			- they also get calls from Pickup contacts
	- End of Day
		- Delivery Reconciliations
		- Pickup Reconciliations
		- No Defects, but Bach SJ wants to know if there is anything that needs attention
	- Clockout of GroundCloud
