# How can I tell what I should _really_ be doing?

I picked up a copy of What Color is Your Parachute at the Goodwill.

I'm starting the self-inventory.

## 1. I am a person who has these favorite kinds of people.

My preferred type of people to work with are the Investigative, the Artistic and the Social.
Holland Code IAS.

>The people we work with are either energy drainers or energy creators.
>They either drag us down and keep us from being our most effective, or they lift us up and help us to be at our best, and perform at our greatest effectiveness.

Types of people I'd most like to work with, in order of preference.
1. People who communicate well and don't leave messes for others.
2. Supportive people not playing power games
3. Good conversationalists.
4. Self-sufficient
5. Non-hierarchical, not into power for power's sake

## 2. I am a person who has favorite working conditions

1. Comfortable, restorative physical activity
2. Quiet
3. Short Commute
4. Open, empty office
5. Flexible working setup - standing/sitting/walking/lying down

## 3. I am a person who can do these particular things

What are skills?
Three types:
1. Data skills
2. People skills
3. Thing skills

>The essence of this approach to job-hunting or career-changing is that once you have identified your favorite transferable skills, and your favorite special knowledges, you may then approach any organization that interests you, whether they have a known vacancy or not.

> Inventory your skills from your stories

### Seven stories when I was enjoying myself
1. When I was in India, I wanted to make an video, part documentary and part art, for my independent study.
    * I had to come up with a structure and methodically work out the details of my vision.
    * I went all around the city patiently filming dogs, people and myself.
    * Then I carefully and painstakingly went through the footage and edited it down to match my idea of what I wanted to see.
    * The result was a 50 minute document that spoke to the meditation practice I had been studying, and also showed the place and the people and some kind of perspective (my perspective).

2. When I was in high school, I made a performance for History Day about the history of hip hop.
    * I had to research the history of hip hop in books
    * I made notes on little cards
    * I used the cards to compose a 10 minute rap about the history of hip hop
    * I performed the report at various levels of competition, and made it to the county level

3. When lived in the North Haven Co-op, I made a performance for the Failure Festival and my friends came to document it.
    * It would be hard to overcome the emotional resistance I had to working through a challenging relationship
    * I composed a 50 minute long monologue about a challenging part of my life
    * I performed the piece in a couple different rehearsals for friends
    * I made lots of notes up on a wall and used them to compose the story
    * I performed the piece in front of an audience of 50+ people

4. When graduated from coding bootcamp, I made the Feldencast
    * There was a group meeting called An AY A Day
    * I wanted to do my own version and work through the material at my own pace, in my own way
    * I started a podcast to move through the lessons in the AY series 1 by 1
    * I made attractive art for each episode
    * I made a website and got the podcast listed on feeds
    * I had grateful listeners from all across the globe interested in the work
    * I continue to gain many followers on instagram based on the art there
    * I learned lessons about creating content - namely, that there are certain things people respond to on social media more than others
    * I didn't actually have too many listeners, and I got tired of doing the project and not getting much feedback.
    * It felt like I was screaming into a void
    * I learned maybe I wasn't doing it for the right reasons 

5. My senior year of college, I did a big honors project called the Oberlin Bachelor Machine
    * I needed to make a project for my cinema studies degree
    * I took a bus trip across the country to visit a bunch of meaningful spots
    * I created a kind of pilgrimage route in a search for deeper meaning
    * In the end I made a report about my trip and received highest honors from the cinema studies department 

6. I had a spat there where I made dance videos.
    * I improvised and filmed them
    * I edited them
    * I posted the videos online 
    * At the end, I applied for an MFA program in dance at CU and I didn't get in
    * The last video I made was of the audition for the MFA program

7. When I got to Boulder, I put my Feldenkrais skills to use doing child care for small infants.
   * I had to take care of a 3 week old baby without any previous experience doing that work
   * I excelled at it and found a profound sense of importance from doing that work.
 
Patterns I can tell from these stories are:
* I create, design
* I synthesize, combine parts into a whole
* I perceive patterns
* I plan
* I compile, keep records
* I make performances

All of myskills are with information and ideas.
The ones I enjoy MOST are conceiving of a project and putting it together into some sort of aesthetic experience.

When I prioritize those skills the order is:
1. Compiling and Keeping Records
2. Perceiving Patterns
3. Arranging Information
4. Synthesizing, Combining Parts into a Whole
5. Project Planning
6. Making Performances
7. Recording (video and audio)

Then there's a category of self-management skills.

> In general, your self-management skills describe:   
> How you deal with time and promptness.  
> How you deal with people and emotions.  
> How you deal with authority, and being told what to do at your job.  
> How you deal with supervision, and being told how to do your job.  
> How you deal with impulse vs. self-discipline, within yourself.  
> How you deal with initiative vs. response, within yourself.
> How you deal with crises or problems.  


Now, Self-Management Skills or Traits. I am very:
* cooperative
* dependable
* flexible
* independent
* open-minded

The thing is to combine the three elements.
Transferable Skill + Specific Domain + Adverb (how you do it specifically).
So, some statements about my transferable skills:
* "I'm good at compiling and keeping records of artistic/creative processes independently"
* "I'm good at arranging information about creative processes in an open minded way"

I'm not sure this encapsulates me. Maybe these could use some more work/time.
But it seems like the takeaway is this:

> When you are face-to-face with a person-who-has-the-power-to-hire-you, you want to be able to explain what makes you different from nineteen other people who can basically do the same thing that you can do.
> It is often the self-management skill, the trait, the adjective or adverb that will save your life, during that explanation.

The thing is, right now, with this process of making the website and investigative whether being a Technical Writer might be a good career for me, it's helpful to see that in the past, I've enjoyed working the most when I'm doing an independent project where I can work on my own, conceiving, arranging and composing some kind of document/documentary of a creative process.

## 4. I am a person who has a certain goal, purpose or mission in life.

The template is: "I want there to be more (blank) in the world because I was here."
