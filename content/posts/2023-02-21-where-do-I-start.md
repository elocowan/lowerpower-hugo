There's a [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/112571/) for Technical Writers.
I found an [interesting post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7030235400161939456?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) about learning API documentation, a special subset of technical writing.
The author mentioned a learning resource called [idratherbewriting.com](https://idratherbewriting.com/).
After an hour of poking around there, seems as good a place to start as any.

I skimmed the author's free course "Documenting APIs" and found where he recommends using static site generators for making documentation websites.

>In the developer documentation space, static site generators dominate the authoring and publishing landscape. HATs and other traditional technical writing tools arenâ€™t used nearly as much.

When recommending static site generators, he explains he is knee deep in Jekyll, but if he were going to start over he would use Hugo.
Based on that, I'll use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
