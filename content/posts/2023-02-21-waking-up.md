## Where am I?

I wake up from a dream.

I open my computer to write it down.
Then for some reason, I check my email.
Then somehow I'm on LinkedIn.
God, why?
How did I get here?
Why am I on LinkedIn at 2:30 in the morning?

Most of my LinkedIn connections are people I went to code school with.
Coding bootcamp.
"$17k. Three months. And all I got was this stinkin' hoodie."

I see a post from Ivan (not his real name).
Before the coding bootcamp, he was an infantry man in the army.
Then code school.
Now he's here on my LinkedIn feed at 2:30am.
I wonder what he's up to.

His post is about some new tech stuff he's learning.
It's the kind of post I associate with someone looking for a job.
A post that says, "I'm constantly improving myself. I'm employable."

It's the same kind of post I saw him making a couple years ago when we were fresh out of the bootcamp. 

But wait.
Doesn't he have a job already?
His profile says he works for a company in Washington State.
A company Jeff Bezos started.
Why would he be posting about self-improvement if he already has a job?
Maybe he's lying.
Maybe he doesn't have that job.

What are my other code school compatriots up to?

Does Fernando have a job?

Yes...

Does Veronica have a job?

Yes...

Man, everyone has a job in the field except me.

## Where am I going?

Wait, what's this?
Fernando's company is hiring a technical writer? 
Maybe I could be a technical writer.

Don't I know some other technical writers?
My old college housemate is some sort of writer at McMaster-Carr.
And that ex of mine who got crazy at the end, wasn't she a technical writer?
I make sure I'm in incognito mode before I look at her profile.

How much do technical writers make? 80k? Seems pretty good.

Well let's say I were going to go for it...
What kind of stuff could I put on a resume?
2-3 years experience? Man...

But hey.
What if I made a blog about technical writing?
What if I made documentation from this initial spark of interest through getting a job in the field?

The point of the blog could be to demonstrate my ability to document technical processes, to generate content that is both efficient and engaging.
And in the process, to learn about technical writing and share what I learn.

That's like a perfect project for me.
Well defined goal.
Go from exactly where I am now, on Feb 21st 2023 to getting a job where I make 80k+ and have good benefits.
Wouldn't it be nice?
