title: Slow Enough to Document

One principle I'd like to follow is to never go faster than I can document.
I have already hit a point with the hugo thing where I can feel myself wanting to speed through something.

I want to do a post about what happens when I do the quicksite start through the hugo website
compared to
What happens when I initialize a site totally from scratch

What files do I end up with in each case?
Why does the quicksite starter WORK immediately?
What are those weird little things that need to be in place before a totally "from scratch" site will work?

When starting totally from scratch with just "hugo new site homesite"
what skeleton does that create?
And what are the steps from having that skeleton to making stuff show up on the webpage?

What do these requirements tell me about what is going on behind the scenes in hugo?
What can I learn about the process through paying attention to the details and not just speeding through?

When I speed through, I lose the opportunity to learn.
I want to focus on the HOW more than the what.

This is a principle I want to follow in the elaboration of this website...
Don't go faster than I can document.
I want each step to make sense before I move on to the next step.
And I want the steps to be documented so I can backtrack if I need to.
And I can see where I went OFF the tracks if I need to.

I'm not yet to the step where I can get these pages to show up on a website in a way that makes sense to me.
So they will continue to be written in my "23.jobchange" file until I have a website sufficiently set up to have these journal entries set up in relation to one another...

The end goal is to have a website that allows me to do my writing in a way that I can structure the process and leave documentation intact...

Principle is, Don't go faster than I can document.
And once I have version control/history it would be cool to have these principles be a living thing..i.
This could be a principle now and not a principle later, and either way is fine cause it can get captured in the git version history :)
