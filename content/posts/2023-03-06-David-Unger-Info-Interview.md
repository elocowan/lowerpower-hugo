## Job Stuff

Started at McMaster Carr as a copy writer.
Taking random weirdo industrial products and boiling them down to their essence and write a few sentences about a traffic cone organizer.

Did that for 3 or 4 months.
McMaster is notorious for moving people around.
They want employees to get 360 view of company.
Know how different parts of the company work, connect dots.

Went into merchandising product development next.
Worked on Robotics team.
How can we better serve customers who use robots?

Moved to Research and Strategy.
Did customer research.
Fascinating.
Range from engineer professor, brainy, developing 3d printer down to Joe Billings over at the old tool and dye shop.
Big spread of humanity.
Interesting to talk to customers about how they use the website and products.

Now... 
Technical writing for external or internal audience?
Now, working on product development strategy.
Doing internal writing and documenting.
They're trying to expand into circuit boards...
So doing research, reading.
Trying to figure out how it works.
Synthesizing to make a case about how to approach these new products they want to pursue.

No longer writing customer facing copy...
But now so much of the job is communication.
Being able to accurately and coherently express complex ideas in words and images.

(what type of design?)

David thought he wanted to go into journalism.
Did appreciate his time in journalism.
Sees a lot of this as an extension of that journalistic drive/desire.
It's going out and interviewing people, distilling it down into accessible language and compelling visuals.

What his 24 year old self wanted out of journalism that isn't present here is the glory of a by line in a newspaper...
Now he's sort of over that.
He would want to have a splashy 12,000 word essay in Harpers!
But his priorities have shifted.

Here, there can be a people management aspect if you want there to be one.
Interest in promotion could bring more managerial duties...
At McMaster, writing is a skill/craft.
A good company will understand that...
Good technical writing skill wouldn't necessarily mean managerial stuff.

## David's Questions
What topic or industry?
- Don't sell myself short... I'm familiar with the API stuff... So david says, "If I were you, I would try to reverse engineer one of thos..."
- Make sure it's something I like and enjoy...
- Build up a portfolio

General career/industry top subject matter:
- Would I ever in a million years try to get a job with FedEx doing some kind of technical documentation with them?
- Have I thought about trying to get a technical writing job with FedEx?

Recommends the name Tanya Raskia.
She's a woman in Chicago who writes about coding.
She had a really good tutorial online about JavaScript.
Writes for Digital Ocean.
She has a cool portfolio website.
She writes stuff for free cause she feels like it helps her learn.

Maybe it would be good to write small simple articles for a place like digital.

David would advocate finding a place with a good office culture, hybrid.
Not totally remote!

"It's not what you do.
It's how you do it and who you do it with?"

"My 24 year old self is apoplectic about getting into industrial supplies..."

"All of us weird obies are able to get interested in random weird things, and this could be a fruitful path to pursue."

"If you want a second pair of eyes on a resume or cover letter or website, lemme know"
