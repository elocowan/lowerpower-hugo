title: What Is a Computer Language?

When looking at documentation examples, I went first to react.
Then I checked out the Hugo docs.
Then I ended up at the Go docs.
And the Go docs were interesting because they are much more generic.

Go is a computer language, and it's not just for creating websites, like Hugo and React.

I'm still learning what a computer language is.
I looked up, What language is Go written in?
I thought maybe I'd find out it was written in C, because it seems like C is the thing that happens underneath a lot of high level languages...
But the wikipedia page says that Go's implementation languages are Go, Assembly language (gc); and C++ (gofrontend).

So I gues Go itself is like C. 
Go is human readable stuff that turns human written instructions into assembly language, which gets turned into machine language (1s and 0s).
I am still doing the work of just understanding what that process is...
