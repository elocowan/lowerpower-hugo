### Website Additions
- differentiate between this form of note taking that I see on localhost and an actual live website for ethancowan.com
- make ethancowan.com a portfolio website, NOT the journal website...
- make a bachsj.com website for documentation on policies and procedures for drivers
	- use hugo
	- use github pages to host
	- maybe get Jordan a domain name?
	- or us MKDocs - it's pretty nice and clean
- figure out how to add subdomains to website
    - dream.ethancowan.com
    - body.ethancowan.com
- add Previous and Next buttons to the post layout
- maybe use a documentation website as a model for my website?
	- examples:
		- [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/)
		- [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)
		- [Go Doc](https://go.dev/doc/)
- redo header to match other docs websites 
	- make it span the whole page, my name in the top right corner, the menu items across the top
	- add CSS so it's responsive at various screen sizes
- reassign ethancowan.com to point to new website
- imitate Go docs, simple header
- put in file path partial to always display what page I'm on and where it is in the directory structure
- add dreams to website
- add search to website (so I can search dreams)

- ~~deploy website on github pages~~ (Done [badly] 2023-03-03)
- ~~add a 'last updated' element to the 'Now' page - want it to update automatically - might need to be using github or something else for this to work~~ (Done 2023-02-28)
- ~~add a 'Now' page~~ (Done 2023-02-28)

### Stuff to Learn
- learn about Hugo page bundles to understand how to organize sequences of stuff (make series of posts out of the raw material of the log)
- [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
    1. Programming
    2. Computer Architecture
    3. Algorithms and Data Structures 
- how to make a computer a TOOL for what I want, less of a site for compulsive behavior

### Content Ideas
- series of posts about ways to minimize screen addiction or compulsive behavior using computers...
   - like, I use intention
   - like, I disabled a lot of the stuff on youtubes page
   - like, I switched my iphone home screen to only have the screentime widget
   - like, what else?
   - I'd like to learn more about controlling screen time habits... I think this is a site of compulsion for our time...
   - what is healthy computer use?
   - I read some idea somewhere, some guy said he would give his kid a computer if it was made such that the kid actually had to learn how to USE it - like a puzzle that could do stuff if you could figure out how to unlock it...
   - it would be fun to make apps that turned a computer into an object that had certain kinds of FRICTION, that required certain types of behavior to Unlock the capacities of the computer
   - what if everything weren't so EASY - what if the computer was a TRAINING device that actually improved your life instead of making you a big ole consumer and surveillance target?

### Workflow Stuff
- once the lowerpower file system is set up right, with page bundles, set up new bash functions (or figure out a more elegant way? macros?) so that single word commands open up markdown templates for dreams, for log page entries, for anything else?

### Feldencast v3
- come up with new recording prodcedure
- record Mia and Gaby book - in its entirety
- figure out how to host the podcast on my site
- post each series as its own page bundle on feldencast.ethancowan.com
- link to new feldencast page on instagram
- make feldencast merch available
