- deploy website on github pages
- reassign ethancowan.com to point to new website

### Stuff to Learn
- learn about Hugo page bundles to understand how to organize sequences of stuff (make series of posts out of the raw material of the log)
- [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
    1. Programming
    2. Computer Architecture
    3. Algorithms and Data Structures 
- how to make a computer a TOOL for what I want, less of a site for compulsive behavior

### Content Ideas
- series of posts about ways to minimize screen addiction or compulsive behavior using computers...
   - like, I use intention
   - like, I disabled a lot of the stuff on youtubes page
   - like, I switched my iphone home screen to only have the screentime widget
   - like, what else?
   - I'd like to learn more about controlling screen time habits... I think this is a site of compulsion for our time...
   - what is healthy computer use?
   - I read some idea somewhere, some guy said he would give his kid a computer if it was made such that the kid actually had to learn how to USE it - like a puzzle that could do stuff if you could figure out how to unlock it...
   - it would be fun to make apps that turned a computer into an object that had certain kinds of FRICTION, that required certain types of behavior to Unlock the capacities of the computer
   - what if everything weren't so EASY - what if the computer was a TRAINING device that actually improved your life instead of making you a big ole consumer and surveillance target?

### Workflow Stuff
- once the lowerpower file system is set up right, with page bundles, set up new bash functions (or figure out a more elegant way? macros?) so that single word commands open up markdown templates for dreams, for log page entries, for anything else?

### Feldencast v3
- come up with new recording prodcedure
- record Mia and Gaby book - in its entirety
- figure out how to host the podcast on my site
- post each series as its own page bundle on feldencast.ethancowan.com
- link to new feldencast page on instagram
- make feldencast merch available
