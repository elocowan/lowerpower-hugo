  <h1>What Is a Computer Language?</h1>
  <p>March 2, 2023</p>
  <p>When looking at documentation examples, I went first to react.
Then I checked out the Hugo docs.
Then I ended up at the Go docs.
And the Go docs were interesting because they are much more generic.</p>
<p>Go is a computer language, and it&rsquo;s not just for creating websites, like Hugo and React.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning what a computer language is.
I looked up, What language is Go written in?
I thought maybe I&rsquo;d find out it was written in C, because it seems like C is the thing that happens underneath a lot of high level languages&hellip;
But the wikipedia page says that Go&rsquo;s implementation languages are Go, Assembly language (gc); and C++ (gofrontend).</p>
<p>So I gues Go itself is like C.
Go is human readable stuff that turns human written instructions into assembly language, which gets turned into machine language (1s and 0s).
I am still doing the work of just understanding what that process is&hellip;</p>
