  <h1>Adding Posts</h1>
  <p>February 23, 2023</p>
  <p>Finally I&rsquo;ll get to the point where I can add these blog posts to the blog.
I am expecting this step to be very gratifying.
I am also expecting it to include lots of reformatting, because I&rsquo;ve been writing all of this stuff as plain text and I&rsquo;ll need to make it all into MarkDown.
I&rsquo;m excited about MarkDown because it&rsquo;s still so close to plain text, and I think it can be opened as plain text (and all of this because I liked Derek Sivers point about writing in plain text), but MarkDown will have some formatting options.</p>
<p>And once there is content on the blog, it will be possible to play with it.
I will be able to play with the formatting, play with the CSS and the styling.
Play with table of contents stuff&hellip;
There will be stuff to play with :)</p>
<h2 id="then-make-a-file-inside-posts-called-_indexmd-with-the-following">So here we go, making the blog.
First, make a directory called posts in the /content/ directory
then make a file inside posts called _index.md with the following:</h2>
<h2 id="title-blog">title: Blog</h2>
<p>&ldquo;_index.md - remember what that means?
It&rsquo;s a table of contents file, and in this case it will be listing the posts.</p>
<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s going to try to use the /layouts/_defualts/list.html layout.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want to use this layout as this page doesn&rsquo;t have any content (and we want the content to come from a template that will list the posts).
So we want a new layout specifically for listing posts.</p>
<p>The way the Hugo layout hierarchy works is it will first look for alayout that matches the current section/directory, then fall back to the global default in _default.
In other words, we can create a new directory called posts in the layouts directory, and inside create &ldquo;list.html&rdquo; with the following content:</p>
<p>{{ define &ldquo;main&rdquo; }}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are a few new concepts in this piece of code:</p>
<ol>
<li>A list page (_index.html) has an array of all its children pages with the variable .Pages.</li>
<li>.Date has format called on it and gets passed a random date in 2006. Why is that? It’s a quirk of Go for formatting dates. You can read more about it here.</li>
<li>.Permalink can be called on any page to get its end URL. It’s particularly useful if you want to link to a page.
That’s all we need for our list page. Let’s move onto a post.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOW, Finally&hellip; Posts!
The posts live in the /content/posts/ directory and don&rsquo;t require an special naming convention.
One tip the tutorial suggests is adding the date of the post to the file name.
This just helps with finding stuff later.</p>
<p>So, now I&rsquo;ll add my 8 posts, including this one :)
Well, I&rsquo;ll start with three, set up the stuff, then see how things look!</p>
<p>Just like the blog list page, these posts will try to use /layouts/_default/single.html.
But we can create a layout specifically for posts at /layouts/posts/single.html.</p>
<p>{{ define &ldquo;main&rdquo; }}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll add the blog to the navigation.
Open /layouts/partials/nav.html
Add another list item:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And voila, all the posts are showing up on the blog page :)
Now I&rsquo;ll spend some time adding the other 5 posts&hellip;
