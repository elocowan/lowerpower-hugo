  <h1>Slow Enough to Document</h1>

<p>One principle I&rsquo;d like to follow is to never go faster than I can document.
I have already hit a point with the hugo thing where I can feel myself wanting to speed through something.</p>
<p>I want to do a post about what happens when I do the quicksite start through the hugo website
compared to
What happens when I initialize a site totally from scratch</p>
<p>What files do I end up with in each case?
Why does the quicksite starter WORK immediately?
What are those weird little things that need to be in place before a totally &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; site will work?</p>
<p>When starting totally from scratch with just &ldquo;hugo new site homesite&rdquo;
what skeleton does that create?
And what are the steps from having that skeleton to making stuff show up on the webpage?</p>
<p>What do these requirements tell me about what is going on behind the scenes in hugo?
What can I learn about the process through paying attention to the details and not just speeding through?</p>
<p>When I speed through, I lose the opportunity to learn.
I want to focus on the HOW more than the what.</p>
<p>This is a principle I want to follow in the elaboration of this website&hellip;
Don&rsquo;t go faster than I can document.
I want each step to make sense before I move on to the next step.
And I want the steps to be documented so I can backtrack if I need to.
And I can see where I went OFF the tracks if I need to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not yet to the step where I can get these pages to show up on a website in a way that makes sense to me.
So they will continue to be written in my &ldquo;23.jobchange&rdquo; file until I have a website sufficiently set up to have these journal entries set up in relation to one another&hellip;</p>
<p>The end goal is to have a website that allows me to do my writing in a way that I can structure the process and leave documentation intact&hellip;</p>
<p>Principle is, Don&rsquo;t go faster than I can document.
And once I have version control/history it would be cool to have these principles be a living thing..i.
This could be a principle now and not a principle later, and either way is fine cause it can get captured in the git version history :)</p>
