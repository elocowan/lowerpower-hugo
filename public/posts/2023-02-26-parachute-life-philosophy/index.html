  <h2 id="parachute-part-2">Parachute Part 2</h2>
<p>My philosophy about life:
I desperately want to find my purpose in life.
I have an intuition that I must have one.
But I&rsquo;ve forgotten.
There are clues to my purpose.
My dreams.
My family, why did I choose them?
My life experiences, especially the times in my life when I&rsquo;ve felt like I was on the right track and being helped forward by something other than my will power.
I am not quite a believer yet, but I have a growing sense of a divine aspect of being alive.
I am seeking more knowledge about why I am here, what my purpose is in life.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-a-person-who-already-has-and-loves-these-particular-knowledges-or-interests">I am a person who already has (and loves) these particular knowledges (or interests):</h2>
<ol>
<li>My favorite hobbies are dancing, journaling, Feldenkrais, writing, composing stuff (music, videos, audio).</li>
<li>I love to talk about present moment experience, about philosophy, about aesthetics&hellip; I love process groups.</li>
<li>I love reading magazine articles about artists, authors, creative people who make things. I also love reading magazine articles about history.</li>
<li>I like reading newspaper articles about local businesses, the stories about people who have created stuff. I like knowing the histories of creation.</li>
<li>In a bookstore I like to browse the staff recommendations. I like to go to the art sections, the religion sections, and I like to look for specific books that were recommended by experts. I want to know what the &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo; is.</li>
<li>On the internet, I like to go to personal websites of individuals with blogs&hellip; I&rsquo;m interested in the individual personalities and how they&rsquo;ve decided to represent themselves. It&rsquo;s fascinating to find people who&rsquo;ve got their idiosyncratic take on coding, programming, making a life online that seems a bit composed, contained. Not messy social media, but people who&rsquo;ve considered how they want things to be organized on their website.</li>
<li>On TV, I like travel shows. I like documentaries about old places, real places, different cultures.</li>
<li>When I look at courses, I&rsquo;d like to take woodworking courses, computer courses. Courses about how to do specific things.</li>
<li>If I could write a book that wasn&rsquo;t about my own life or someone else&rsquo;s, the book would be about music and the way it relates to spiritual experience.</li>
<li>When I get engrossed in activities to the point that I lose all sense of time, it&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m working on a creative project that was sparked by something inside me. Almost all of my seven stories about enjoying myself involve this kind of engrossment&hellip; And they were all about documenting a set of aesthetic ideas and composing them in various media.</li>
</ol>
