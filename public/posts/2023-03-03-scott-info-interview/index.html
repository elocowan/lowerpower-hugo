  <h1>Scott Melamed Informational Interview</h1>
  <p>March 3, 2023</p>
  <h2 id="how-did-you-get-into-this">how did you get into this?</h2>
<p>Knew he had to leave community group cause they were running out of money.
Will I go to a different community group or try to do something different?
Just got engaged.</p>
<p>Had some rough interpersonal experiences in the neighborhood group.
Questioning a lot.
Recalling how he&rsquo;s an introvert, but community depends on social element.
Felt like he&rsquo;d lost touch with something.</p>
<p>He thought, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good portion of it that doesn&rsquo;t depend on communication/relationships in the same way that organizing does.&rdquo;
Wanted to make more money based on getting married, maybe having a kid, etc.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what my options would be, but&hellip;
Technical writing was one.
I thought writing was a skill I have.
When I looked at what&rsquo;s expected, I could piece together things I&rsquo;d done that fit the bill.
Pieces were from first job in DC was production of legally binding contractual documents&hellip; involved terms of art.
Description for technical writing included getting opinions and perspectives from different departments.
Pulled from writing in community group.
Led creation of strategic plan for earlier community group.
Created document through collaboration&hellip;
Pulled all those things together.</p>
<p>Medtronic often hire people without specific experience in technical writing.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d survive at a corporation where he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily agree with what they&rsquo;re doing.
Medtronic seemed to mesh with his values.
Felt like, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get THIS, I don&rsquo;t know what I would do&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knew that medtronic is a company that tries to retain employees.
Lots of people stay there for their entire career.</p>
<p>Talked to David, because he was a technical writer&hellip; Helped Scott imagine that there would be a way to live, working for something different.</p>
<h2 id="introversion">Introversion?</h2>
<ul>
<li>massive corporation</li>
<li>whole job is remote</li>
<li>bulk of what he does doesn&rsquo;t involve meetings&hellip;</li>
<li>plenty of needing to talk, but everything doesn&rsquo;t HINGE on communication</li>
<li>some collegues have a tough time even relating&hellip; so it&rsquo;s not a requirement, but it&rsquo;s been helpful</li>
<li>that part of things, hoping for the introversion, has panned out.</li>
<li>but he goes to work in a setting, like a cafe, so he&rsquo;s not home alone</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="me">Me?</h2>
<ul>
<li>physicality element is super sedentary - this is deskwork</li>
<li>this is computer work!!</li>
<li>essentially it&rsquo;s ZERO physicality</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-stuff-specific-to-scott">Other stuff specific to Scott</h2>
<ul>
<li>not primarily writing</li>
<li>he creates instructions for use for medical devices</li>
<li>intention isn&rsquo;t actually to instruct people, it&rsquo;s actually a legal document to protect the company, so you can say, &ldquo;We provided this information&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>job is talking to 12 or so different divisions towards the creation of this document</li>
<li>so it&rsquo;s project management!
<ul>
<li>some writing</li>
<li>but chasing people down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s a lot of people needing to review or give their signature or approve something</li>
<li>lots of deadlines to keep track of</li>
<li>lots of forms, spreadsheets, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="david-good-to-talk-to">David, good to talk to</h2>
<ul>
<li>he has a great tolerance for boring activity</li>
<li>in that context, he&rsquo;s good at knowing what his boring skills are</li>
<li>he is into data analysis, excel spreadsheet wonkery, etc.</li>
<li>he keeps his ears tuned for opportunities to use his skills for things that are more in his wheelhouse</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="good">Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corporation really wants him to succeed and to stay there</li>
<li>Likes people he works with</li>
<li>No one is toxic in any serious way</li>
<li>company&rsquo;s mission is important - he has a good sense of why</li>
<li>Scott&rsquo;s mom has a medtronic product inside her, right now</li>
<li>As a curious person, he&rsquo;s getting to have a completely new experience, professionally&hellip;
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s not just the medical aspect that&rsquo;s new</li>
<li>aspects of</li>
<li>he is working in cardiac surgery, so he&rsquo;s learning a lot of anatomical stuff</li>
<li>learning about the regulation around medical products - heavily regulated industry</li>
<li>and it&rsquo;s an international company, so it&rsquo;s interesting to learn about the different regulations in different countries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>being alone, working alone is really hard</li>
<li>he learned to respond to incentives that come from being aorund other people
<ul>
<li>not wanting to let them down</li>
<li>learning about how to act from seeing how others act</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>not easy for someone who tends toward anxiety/depression</li>
<li>need things to meet exact guidelines, and that can be really exhausting</li>
<li>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thrown up my hands&rdquo;</li>
<li>trying to stay focused</li>
<li>work itself is the hardest aspect, because it&rsquo;s possible to get into the anxiety cycle of too much work -&gt; avoid it -&gt; piles up</li>
<li>working now on chipping away at the big pile</li>
</ul>
<p>At the community organizing group, it was okay to take time to lie down after a therapy session&hellip; Wonky work hours to meet personal needs. That&rsquo;s not as much the case with this job.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t reached the point yet of giving up&hellip;</p>
<p>Really meaningful to be making good money, like 78k.
It&rsquo;s cool to know</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<ul>
<li>Experience with XML is huge</li>
<li>Working with any software to make technical documentation</li>
<li>Medtronic hires people who&rsquo;ve done other things because the company is old and has idiosyncratic ways of business.</li>
<li>Tons of learning on the job.</li>
<li>Asked his 5 year anniversary workmate&hellip; She feels like she still doesn&rsquo;t have a firm handle on all the documentation of how stuff works at medtronic.</li>
<li>Scott just tried to look at the description on the job opening</li>
<li>Scott did an informational interview with someone in the neighborhood who worked at Medtronic in that department, so he had an introduction to someone working as a technical writer&hellip;</li>
<li>Helpful for him to look and see that based on his own experience, he could make a case for himself.</li>
<li>Started as a contractor&hellip; Only got hired full time a few months ago.</li>
<li>lucked out because there was a manager that was really advocating for him, and he found a window where a hiring freeze was lifted&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="suggestion-to-look-at-medtronic">Suggestion to look at Medtronic</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scott is one worker in a 100,000 person company!</li>
<li>Maybe scott could provide an entree</li>
<li>Scott said there&rsquo;s software that medtronic uses to make the documentation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="any-last-things">Any last things?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know what it would be like to do this job at a place other than MedTronic</li>
<li>If it were amazon, I don&rsquo;t know if I could spiritually survive it.</li>
<li>One way that this works is that the thing produced by the company is something that&rsquo;s worth having in the world.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not like medtronic is innocent - all the metals involved, what connections to the mining industry</li>
<li>They used to have a pig farm to grow heart valves&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sucks-that-physicality-cant-be-my-job-from-scotts-perspective">sucks that physicality can&rsquo;t be my job (from scott&rsquo;s perspective)</h2>
