  <h1>Waking Up</h1>
  <p>February 21, 2023</p>
  <p>Man, just deleted a bunch of stuff I wrote here.</p>
<p>The gist was, tell the story of the first post to this as yet unsubstantiated blog.</p>
<p>Tell it with some details related to waking up in the middle of the night, getting tempted by a linkedIn thing from Sergei&hellip; Why is he posting a code challenge think? Doesn&rsquo;t he have a job already? Yep, he works for some company that Jeff Bezos started?</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s lying.
But what are my other code school compatriots up to?</p>
<p>Does Honorio have a job?
Yes&hellip;
Man, everyone has a job in the field except me.</p>
<p>Wait, Honorio&rsquo;s company is hiring a technical writer? Thanks for the prompt, linkedIn.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t I know some other technical writers?
David at McMaster-Carr.
Look up Bernadette but make sure to be on incognito mode so she doesn&rsquo;t know I was looking&hellip;</p>
<p>And then a little bit of searching to see what the job prospects are like&hellip; 80k? Seems pretty good.</p>
<p>Well let&rsquo;s say I were going to go for it&hellip;
What kind of stuff would I have to put on a resume?
2-3 years experience? Man&hellip;</p>
<p>But hey, What if I made a blog about this whole process, from this initial spark of interest going all the way up through getting a job?
And the point of the blog is to demonstrate my ability to document technical processes, to generate content that is both efficient and engaging&hellip;
And in the process, to learn about technical writing and to share what I learn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a perfect project for me.
Well defined goal.
Go from exactly where I am now, on Feb 21st 2023 to getting a job where I make 80k+ and have good benefits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super clean, in one sense.</p>
<p>AND, the project parameters also allow for lots of space to experiment.
I can muse on a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s interesting to me - it&rsquo;s a BLOG after all&hellip;
And yet I will be accountable to the process, to an imagined audience (potential employers), plus other people who might be interested in technical writing.
I can use the space to write entries about a variety of topics I&rsquo;m interested in.
Writing about how to make the blog, from a technical perspective, will show my comfortability with code, etc.</p>
<p>I also wrote down a bunch of other stuff I&rsquo;d like to write about, but then I misued Vi and deleted it all&hellip;
Plus I should get some sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to learn about what to name the blog.
One thing I know, and it&rsquo;s a good thing to end on, maybe, is that I have a significant amount of ENERGY around this&hellip;
And writing is something I like and I could do by myself and I could do remotely and I could do by engaging with technical people smarter than I am, to understand enough about what they know to translate it for other people who don&rsquo;t know as much as they know.
I think technical writing could be a really good job for me.</p>
<p>It would also be cool to come at this from a Humane Tech perspective, from the beginning.</p>
<p>To write about my own struggles with tech addiction and my desire to have a better life that involves technology but isn&rsquo;t determined by it.
It&rsquo;s hard for me to separate that from writing, because I like the act of writing, and that act is always taking place on these devices that link to behaviors I don&rsquo;t like&hellip;
Maybe it&rsquo;s one of my job criteria to work for a company that is working on making technology more humane.</p>
<p>5:56am
Maybe a second blog post would be about gathering specifications for the project.
Looking at a number of current technical writer jobs to see what software companies are looking for, so that I can demonstrate those skills through the implementation of my project.
This could be a certain type of posting, looking at one attractive listing per post, breaking down the requirements of the post and doing research/documentation on the various technical terms within the post itself.
