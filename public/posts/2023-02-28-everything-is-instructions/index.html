  <h1>Everything I Love is Instructions</h1>

  <h2 id="the-thread-through">The thread through</h2>
<p>Technical writing is about instructions.
It&rsquo;s all about helping people with reference material.
&ldquo;Getting Started.&rdquo;
How to do this certain thing.</p>
<p>Strangely, we live in a world where it&rsquo;s possible to watch a bunch of how-to material for entertainment.
It&rsquo;s very easy to be a consumer of &ldquo;how to&rdquo; without every actually doing the thing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m seeing that there is a thread that connects this Technical Writing aspiration to other parts of my life.
It connects to all my &ldquo;engrossed&rdquo; stories because all those stories are based on me following instructions.</p>
<ol>
<li>History Day - instructions on how to do research</li>
<li>Development Area - implied instructions from Bill Viola (I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like)</li>
<li>Bachelor Machine - instructions on how to do MyStory</li>
<li>Feldencast - instructions on how to make a Gatsby Site, How to Make a Podcast</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m making it map a little <em>too</em> cleanly, but there&rsquo;s a thread here.
I love using instructions in a creative way, to achieve my own ends.</p>
<p>And this project of becoming a technical writer has legs because it is another chance for me to follow some instructions <em>and</em> tailor them to my needs.</p>
<p>Plus, the internet is an enormous repository of instructions at this point.
And making myself a site where I document the instructions that have been most helpful to me&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh&hellip;
6. Reading the book &ldquo;History of Last Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; is another example of reading an instructional book about How to Dream</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to have this bigger picture.
This relates to me understanding my purpose.
And it also embeds the desire to become a technical writer into a bigger composition of my life.
It makes sense to pursue a career that is about making content that helps people do stuff.
But making that a writing activity instead of a face-to-face activity.</p>
