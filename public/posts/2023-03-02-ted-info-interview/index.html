  <h1>Ted Burnham Informational Interview</h1>
  <p>March 2, 2023</p>
  <h2 id="how-did-you-get-into-this-work">How did you get into this work?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Radio and podcast journalism</li>
<li>freelancing</li>
<li>startup with audio/video production - Avenoo</li>
<li>Sass Product - early stages, fluidity in the role</li>
<li>ended up doing a lot of UI input</li>
<li>Developer team needed UX copywriting stuff because they didn&rsquo;t speak english as a first language</li>
<li>Then doing UX copywriting for a big telecom - that exposed him to UX side and technical writing - shipping kits where people get kits with a modem, so they had instructions about setting that up&hellip;</li>
<li>Physical stuff, instructional manual, in addition to UX copy on an app</li>
<li>Current role is technical writing, but at least 50% other stuff.</li>
<li>Big plus is variety and ability to leverage different skills to touch documentation in various places</li>
<li>Making all the documentation for spot, the dog!</li>
<li>Talk to the engineers about how everything works&hellip; about how to sell it.</li>
<li>Opportunities to hang out with smart people, learn new things, and keeping on top of where things are</li>
<li>Not responsible for selling stuff, BUT&hellip; There&rsquo;s a close relationship between how good the docs are and how publicly exposed that is AND your ability to get and retain customers&hellip; Especially true of SASS platforms&hellip; people have the expectiation of finding an answer on the website&hellip;</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a selling point to have really strong documentation</li>
<li>Working on guide to help folks go from about to buy the robots but we have to get the whole team to get together, all the stuff they need to get the implementation up and running. More of a guide to how to start the product&hellip; It&rsquo;s a bridge from the purchase to actually having the robot part of the project.</li>
<li>So the role has a significant slice that&rsquo;s about what happens right after the sale&hellip;</li>
<li>People look at help docs before they make a purchase&hellip; Anecdotally, customers really appreciate available documentation. Make a lot of stuff public. Awareness that a lot of people will see it, but 95%</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-you-like-most-about-it">What do you like most about it?</h2>
<h2 id="what-do-you-like-least-about-it">What do you like least about it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Content management platform makes a huge difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the tool you have to use to get the content out there&hellip;it can be shitty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right now they build articles in salesforce cause that&rsquo;s what runs the help tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shifting into poligo, which has advantages&hellip; Now they don&rsquo;t have to build the article in salesforce&hellip; Build outside, and someone else can worry about publishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools make a big impact on what it feels like to do the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He learned, through working at a startup, cathearding and project management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount of cat herding&hellip; Folks who make the stuff are busy building it&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of chasing down and following up - you don&rsquo;t get to just have all the information and crank down on it&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to work with people, but there&rsquo;s a lot of the time where it feels like nagging&hellip; Asking a question dooesn&rsquo;t line up with their expectations and their answers don&rsquo;t line up with my</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One on one with someone who values documentation can be fun. Deep dives can be really excit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Value he brings is from journalism background.
Spent time learning how to interview folks about technical subjects.
Turn their jargon into entertaining stuff that is readable.
Process is discovery and holding a customer persona in mind.</p>
<p>Really glad to have had the experience of doing UX work, which is different but also closely related to technical writing.</p>
<p>TW is working on an ARTICLE
UX is microcopy of &ldquo;what should that individual button be called&rdquo;?</p>
<p>But both need to have the customer mental model at the center.
The technical documentation sits in the UX, it&rsquo;s a part of the user experience.
People will look at the help center when they have a problem and they want that to go quickly so they can get back into the thing that they&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>Depends strongly on the type of product, as well&hellip;
Very technical at Boston Dynamics&hellip; Sort of like writing manual for an industrial machine, but then there&rsquo;s also a touch screen app interface that they want to feel like using instagram on the iPhone. Should be easy. It needs to be that accessible. The people using it are going to be</p>
<p>If you work more on the consumer end, you&rsquo;ll have more freedom with the tone you set, how much depth the articles go into&hellip;</p>
<p>Working on writing content for the help center or the support center</p>
<p>What kind of company</p>
<p>What didn&rsquo;t I ask about that I should?</p>
<ul>
<li>Salary -</li>
<li>Interview processes -</li>
<li>Try to talk to a hiring manager that&rsquo;s like a company that I want to work with.</li>
<li>For boston dynamics, he was asked to have a portfolio example or to put one together&hellip; Pick any product you like, write a one pager explaining something about it.</li>
<li>Having portfolio pieces is good.</li>
<li>Friend whos is trying to get into web design and coding and he&rsquo;s been working on open source projects&hellip;</li>
<li>Ted doesn&rsquo;t follow technical writing specific resources, but there&rsquo;s one from the UX writing hub</li>
<li>&ldquo;Because we sit in between the customer and their problems, there are a lot of opportunities to do UX feedback. We see what they&rsquo;re struggling with, when new things are being developed&hellip; we can offer&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Writers in tech&rdquo; podcast&hellip;</li>
<li>More nebulous sense of skills and career than just &ldquo;technical writer&rdquo;.</li>

<ul>
<li>He mentioned in passing it might be good to talk with a hiring manager at a company like one I&rsquo;d like to work at&hellip; To ask them&hellip; what? I&rsquo;m not sure what I would ask a hiring manager, but I like the idea of doing a low stakes informational interview with someone in that role.</li>
