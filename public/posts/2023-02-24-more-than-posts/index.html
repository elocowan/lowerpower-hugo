  <h2 id="pages-vs-posts">Pages vs. Posts</h2>
<p>I have lots of ideas about what I want to do with computers.
The most pressurized idea is Get a Job.</p>
<p>But there are other ideas too.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to learn C.</li>
<li>I want to go through the curriculum of <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself CS</a>.</li>
<li>I want to build a habit tracker.</li>
<li>I want to build a screentime dashboard for macOS, to curb my bad screentime habits.
Basically, I want to understand computers better, because they are so ubiquitous and the site of almost all of my compulsive behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>A computer is a tool, but right now it feels like the tool uses me, somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway, I want to write more than just posts on this website.
I like the idea of having the blog, because it can be a record of my thoughts about what to do&hellip;
But I also want to have project areas on the site so that I have a sense of making progress and also finishing stuff.</p>
<p>Making a blog is one of the things I want to do.
I also have the idea of becoming a technical writer.
I want to write a post about my education, the trainings I&rsquo;ve done and what types of professional life I thought they&rsquo;d lead to vs. what they did lead to.
That could be a blog post.</p>
<p>But it would be great to have a spot on this website where I have a list of ideas.
It would be a list of possibilities, projects that it might be cool to do.
It would be more like a PAGE, a page that gets updated.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>An ideas page.
And a now page.
Other types of pages would be the about page and the home page.</p>
<p>I think the first page I should make is the now page, because that&rsquo;s the place I can update which of the ideas I am working on now.
The ideas page is kind of like a queue.
&ldquo;My queue&rdquo;
The first thing on &ldquo;my queue&rdquo; should be to make &ldquo;my queue&rdquo; and &ldquo;now&rdquo;</p>
