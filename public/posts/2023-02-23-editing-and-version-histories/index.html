  <h1>Editing and Version Histories</h1>
  <p>February 23, 2023</p>
  <p>I would like to start editing the posts that I&rsquo;ve got on the site now.
But I don&rsquo;t want to lose any information about what they are/were like in their original state.
So I think I need to use and understand git at this point.</p>
<p>For context, I haven&rsquo;t initiated git on this project yet.
And I definitely haven&rsquo;t pushed anything to github.
And I&rsquo;m even farther away from publishing anything&hellip;</p>
<p>But I am starting to think about version controls, I guess just because I&rsquo;m weird like that?
I&rsquo;m &lsquo;weird like that&rsquo; in the sense that I want to be able to see how any of these documents change over time.
&lsquo;Weird&rsquo; because I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll ever look at the history, but I would like to be able to.
I don&rsquo;t know WHY, and that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-git-work">How does git work?</h2>
<p>So, what do I do first to get git going?
First thing I&rsquo;m going is going to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs">git docs</a>.
In the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">git tutorial</a>, there are simple instructions for placing a project under git revision control.
just cd into the project folder and</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git init
</code></pre><p>Git will reply</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
</code></pre><p>I have to use <code>ls -a</code> to see the git repository in the directory, so I guess it&rsquo;s typically hidden.</p>
<p>Next I am going to tell Git to take a snapshot of the contents of all files under the current directory with <em>git add</em>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git add .
</code></pre><p>Now there is a whole bunch of stuff in the .git folder.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Ethans-MacBook-Air:.git dreamer$ ls
HEAD		description	index		objects
config		hooks		info		refs
</code></pre><p>Then the commit:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git commit
</code></pre><p>This command prompts me for a commit message.
It happens to launch VSCode.
What I want is for it to open a new terminal window and prompt me to enter the commit message in Vim.
The answer is in the docs about <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config">setup and config</a>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config --global core.editor &#34;vim --nofork&#34;
</code></pre><p>Next time it should open the prompt to write a commit message in Vim in the terminal.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished.
Now there is a snapshot of the whole project as it stands now, at the end of the third day.
I have gotten all of the posts into the website.
The next step is to go in and edit them plus format them.</p>
<h2 id="next-time">Next time</h2>
<p>Some open questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should I organize the posts? Because it&rsquo;s nice to have them in chronological order, but it would also be nice to set things up in series.</li>
<li>What are some examples of other folks&rsquo; documentation websites?</li>
<li>How can I set up next and previous links through a series of posts</li>
<li>It would be cool to make a Dream series, a Feldenkrais series, and a Computer series
<ul>
<li>is the best way to do this with Tags? Categories? something else?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
